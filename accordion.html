						Fetal Heartrate Monitor for Android</br>
						<span class="subtitle">Role: Team Leader and Programmer</span></br>
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						The goal of this team-based project is to create an Arduino-based fetal heartrate monitor for developing countries. My job as programmer is to design the product, including hardware and software. The current device is an arduino and sound shield connected to a supersensitive microphone. The arduino collects data and sends it to the phone for further processing. Using established protocols by Jhpiego, the app will notify and warn the mother of emergencies where medical intervention may be required. In addition, the app will also function as a tocodynomometer.

						Tablet Based Method for Handwriting Assesment</br>

						This research project is concerned with automating the analysis of handwriting from autistic children to assess mental growth with easy-to-use tablet apps and cloud-based processing. As mobile developer, I am in charge of front-end design, creating both an iOS and Android tablet app to record data and immediately send it to the cloud for further processing and analysis by various Matlab and Python scripts. The findings of this project were published in a paper, which you can view <a href="www.victorjdadfar.me/projects/Tablet_Poster.pdf">here</a>.

						In addition to group projects, I enjoy taking on my own challenges, creating applications that are visually appealing, useful, or exciting. In many cases, the development process teaches me something new. In the past I've worked on games, 3D libraries, and websites, among other projects. Currently I am improving my skills with web design, and intend to jump into mobile development again with Swift.

						Contraceptive Implant Training Tool (CITT Kit)</br>
						<span class="subtitle">Role: Design Team Member</span></br>
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						This design team is tasked with creating a device to teach nurses and midwives the proper insertion and removal techniques for contraceptive implants. The current revision is a model of the arm created from several layers of silicon representing the various layers of fat, muscle and skin. This product is aimed at developing markets, so the arm model needed to be cheap and easy to manufacture, as well as resistant to harsh enviroments including high temperatures and humidity. As of May 2015, this design was patented by the United States Patent Office.

						3D Tracking and Feedback of an Ultrasonic Probe</br>
						<span class="subtitle" id="thor-subtitle">Role: Lead Programmer</span></br>
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						This research project aims to track an ultrasonic probe and warn the user when the probe is not aligned properly to avoid suboptimal imaging. As lead developer for this project, I am designing both the hardware and software for this device. The current setup consists of an arduino attached to an accelerometer. A Processing script collects data from the arduino and uses it to manipulate a virtual model of the ultrasonic probe, showing its orientation in real time. The Processing script also tracks relative motions of the accelerometer to determine its position.
