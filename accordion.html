						Registration of Surgical Trackers from Radiographic Images</br>
						<span class="subtitle" id="thor-subtitle">Role: Research Assistant</span></br>
					</p>
					<hr noshade>
					<p>
						This research project attempts to determine if regular infrared markers can be identified and registered from radigraphic images. Generally, infrared markers are meant only to work with IR tracking systems due to reflective spheres on the marker. These markers have very little distinction in their 3D shape, meaning that rotating or translating their image may produce no noticable differences in shape from certain perspectives. This poses a problem for registration from radiographic images - especially when those images show no distinct differences in shape. Being able to register IR markers from radiographic imaging would allow for the possibility of movement of the marker during surgery, giving the surgeon more freedom to operate on the patient.

						Fetal Heartrate Monitor &amp; Tocodynomometer</br>
						<span class="subtitle">Role: Design Team Leader and Programmer</span></br>
					</p>
					<hr noshade>
					<p>
						The goal of this team-based project is to create an Arduino-based fetal heartrate monitor for developing countries. My job as programmer is to design the product, including hardware and software. The current device is an arduino and sound shield connected to a supersensitive microphone. The arduino collects data and sends it to the phone for further processing. Using established protocols by Jhpiego, the app will notify and warn the mother of emergencies where medical intervention may be required. In addition, the app will also function as a tocodynomometer.

				        Patient Information Access in a Clinical Setting</br>
						<span class="subtitle">Role: Design Team Member</span></br>
					</p>
					<hr noshade>
					<p>
						This design team is focusing on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical appointments through greater patent access. In the United States healthcare system, there are many sources of waste that lead to time and money loss for both the patients and the clinicians. We believe that there are needs that can combat these sources of waste, and when those needs are addressed, waste decreases. The project has been worked on for only a few months, but we are close to determining the exact need and solution we would like to pursue.

						Contraceptive Implant Training Tool (CITT Kit)</br>
						<span class="subtitle">Role: Design Team Member</span></br>
					</p>
					<hr noshade>
					<p>
						This design team was tasked with creating a device to teach nurses and midwives the proper insertion and removal techniques for contraceptive implants. The current revision is a model of the arm created from several layers of silicon representing the various layers of fat, muscle and skin. This product was aimed at developing markets, so the arm model needed to be cheap and easy to manufacture, as well as resistant to harsh enviroments including high temperatures and humidity. As of May 2015, this design was patented by the United States Patent Office.

						Low Cost Method of Motion Tracking for a Medical Probe</br>
						<span class="subtitle" id="thor-subtitle">Role: Lead Programmer</span></br>
					</p>
					<hr noshade>
					<p>
						This research project aims to track an ultrasonic probe and warn the user when the probe is not aligned properly to avoid suboptimal imaging. As lead developer for this project, I am designing both the hardware and software for this device. The current setup consists of an arduino attached to an accelerometer. A Processing script collects data from the arduino and uses it to manipulate a virtual model of the ultrasonic probe, showing its orientation in real time. The Processing script also tracks relative motions of the accelerometer to determine its position.
